That is the first line of the preface of "Lean Enterprise" and I completely agree with that statement.

I recently read "Lean Enterprise" written by Jez Humble, Joanne Molesky, and Barry O'Riley while on vacation. Not only did the ocean breeze feel great while reading it, the book was jam packed with excellent content as well. As someone who has completed an MBA, this is one of those books I wished would have been integrated into the curriculum. However, this book is targeted towards larger companies that provide software to their customers but many of the principles contained in this book are applicable to companies of nearly any size.

The authors take a different aproach to how an organization should approach what they work on and how they work on it. For example, lets assume that Company A has a development team that provides software to Company X. Instead of measuring performance by counting the number of user stories or bugs that the team completes, performance is measured by how much work completed benefits the Company A's customer: Company X. It's easy for someone to arbitrarily keep themselves busy and say, "I made thing X, Y, Z." But, if X, Y, or Z don't benefit the customer or make it easier to support the customer then thing X, Y, and Z were a waste of time. The book heavily reinforces working on tasks and projects that will eventually benefit the customer and keeping the HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) effect at bay.

One of the approaches the authors use to decide on what tasks or projects should be worked on is called Cost of Delay. Instead of ranking a backlog of items based upon what the opinions of the development team or HiPPO, the cost associated with delaying those items is the deciding factor in how to prioritize work. The "cost" in question can be measured in monetary losses to the company (fines, penalties, etc.) or estimated future reveunues lost for delaying each item. This will keep your development team and organization focused on making decisions that can reduce unnecessary costs and increase revenues for the company.

One reoccuring quote that kept popping up in the book was, "You build it, you support it." What this means is that the team that is building Service B should support Service B until it is mature enough to be handed off to a different team for management. What this does is keeps the team thinking about how updates to Service B will effect the functionalty of Service B. Instead on focusing on developing an arbitrary number of features, the reliability and stability of Service B will weigh heavily in determining if updates to Service B will make it into production.

In conclusion, organizations should keep the customer in focus, use cost of delay, and teams should support the services they build. those were the three principles that spoke to me the most. Of course, there are many other principles that can be found in the pages of this book. However, depending on your role in your organization and your life-long experiences will make certain chapters speak to you more than others.

Overall rating: 9/10.
